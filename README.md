# Diff-equation
A program to solve differential equation
For the moment, only second order linear differential equations can be solved.

# Requirements
- gcc (a recent version should work)
You need to have the math.h header file somewhere (should be provided by default)

# Usage
Run make to compile the program:
```
$> make
```

Then just run diffeq, located in the bin directory:
```
$> ./bin/diffeq
```

# Objectives
- Being able to run it from command line
- Having command line options
- Finding solutions that verify initial conditions
